# MonsterEnergyCollection
In this app you are able to collect different cans of the Monster Energy drink.
Some of the functionalities which are implented are: creating accounts, having proper authorization depending on the account, scanning barcodes, leaving comments, leaving ratings and a few more. The focus of this project was to make a fully functioning CRUD application which is tested every step of the way and is also secure. I have implemented intergration testing, unit testing, end-to-end testing and UX tests. The application is also protected against the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities and a few more. 
The front-end is written in ReactJS with Tailwind and the back-end REST API is written in Spring Boot.

### back-end installation
The back-end is really easy to install. All you have to do is open it with Intellij Idea and it will automatically download everything.
You do need to adjust some env variables like a database and sonarqube if you need it.

### front-end installation
Fistly you need to install all the plugins and packages
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
And then you are all set to start it with
```
npm start
```

### What did I learn?
I learned a lot more about testing and security. I really dove into a bunch of testing software like Cypress, Sonarqube and Snyk. I also learned about authorization and authentication. It was also completly new for me to work with Java, Spring boot and React. Adjusting to Java was quite easy and Spring boot also wasn't too difficult. I struggled for a while with React and using the right states but I also learned a lot from it!
