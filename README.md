# MonsterEnergyCollection
In this app you are able to collect different cans of the Monster Energy drink.
Some of the functionalities which are implented are: creating accounts, having proper authorization depending on the account, scanning barcodes, leaving comments, leaving ratings and a few more. The focus of this project was to make a fully functioning CRUD application which is tested every step of the way and is also secure. I have implemented intergration testing, unit testing, end-to-end testing and UX tests. The application is also protected against the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities and a few more. 
The front-end is written in ReactJS with Tailwind and the back-end REST API is written in Spring Boot.
